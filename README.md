# Development-and-Modelling-of-an-Air-Contactor-Unit-for-CO2-capture-Direct-Air-Capture-
Development and Modelling of an Air Contactor Unit for CO2 capture (Direct Air Capture)
The main objective is to support YamaCarbon in designing and developing its own Air Contactor unit. The study aims to:
Describe the CO2 mass transfer phenomenon in the gas-liquid reactor, including direct correlations with acceptable assumptions (1D or 2D models); and
Develop a model for a cross-flow gas-liquid contactor using Aspen Plus.
 
 System Parameters
The air contactor unit to be designed was with the following initial parameters from Yama Carbon:
100 tCO2/y capacity (or 45 kgCO2/h with an uptime of 25% - as it is a pilot unit it will not run 100% of the time)
Typical CO2 capture ratio expected is 70%
Inlet CO2 concentration can be considered at 420 ppm (or equivalent range)
