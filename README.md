Development and Modelling of an Air Contactor Unit for CO2 capture (Direct Air Capture)
The main objective is to support YamaCarbon in designing and developing its own Air Contactor unit. The study aims to:
Describe the CO2 mass transfer phenomenon in the gas-liquid reactor, including direct correlations with acceptable assumptions (1D or 2D models); and
Develop a model for a cross-flow gas-liquid contactor using Aspen Plus.
